## Shell Scripting

This section introduces shell scripting with an emphasis on control structures and the `vim` editor.

### Introduction to `vim` Editor

### Syntax of Control Structures

### Shell Scripting Programs
- Addition of two numbers
- Check whether a number is odd/even
- Check whether a year is a leap year
- Calculate the average salaries of employees
- Calculate the average marks of students
- Calculate the circumference and area of a circle
- Sum of the digits of a number
- Factorial of a number
- Fibonacci series
- Check if a number is prime
- Check if a number is a palindrome
- Reverse a given number
- Create a binary calculator using switch case
- Linear search
- Binary search
- Bubble sort

### String Operations in `vim` Editor
- Find length of a string
- Compare two strings
- Reverse a string
- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Find occurrence of a pattern
- Concatenate strings
- Convert lowercase letters into uppercase

### File Operations in `vim` Editor
- Check permissions of a file and determine if it is a file or directory
- Rename a file
- Take backup of a directory
- Compare directories and delete duplicate files
- Check the number of files through command line arguments
- Copy first argument to second and so on if the number of files is even, else display odd
- Number of arguments
- Convert lowercase letters into uppercase
- Calculate length of a file

## C++ Programming

This section covers various CPU scheduling algorithms and memory management algorithms in C++.

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) (Preemptive, Non-Preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (Preemptive, Non-Preemptive)
- Round Robin (RR)

### Banker's Algorithm
